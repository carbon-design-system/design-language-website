Avoid elements that make a visualization appear complex, distant or disjointed. You can achieve this effect using established typographic and visual communication principles that enhance the form, readability and meaning. You should remove anything gratuitous and avoid ambiguity or unnecessary embellishments that distract the user from the main concept.

Ensure each visual representation corresponds to the relative numerical quantity, and pay attention to the proportions and scale of the elements to keep the integrity of the data.
