This dynamic intuitively leads us to apply an inverse relationship\nbetween the complexity of a design and the complexity of an animation. In\ngeneral, minimally populated compositions lend themselves to more expressive and\nexpansive animation, while dense and complex designs benefit from smaller, more\ntextural motion.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n<GifPlayer>\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-complexity1.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-complexity1-poster.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<Caption>Detailed visuals call for subtle animations.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n<GifPlayer>\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-complexity2.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-complexity2-poster.jpg)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<Caption>Simple designs allow for dynamic animation.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Detail\n\nIn animation, the accuracy of a form in any key pose should adhere to the same\nrigorous standards used in creating the design. During transitions from one key\nto another, strive to maintain clean and precise silhouettes by avoiding odd\nshapes, irregular angles, overlaps and intersections, unless explicitly desired\nas an effect.\n\nA similar level of attention should be paid to the briefest of moments. For\nexample, avoid creating irregularities during the overlap of transparent shapes\nby animating between swatch colors, not opacity. Maintain crisp graphic lines by\nincreasing the stroke weight from zero to the thickness, not crossfading.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Animated stroke weights maintain clean and crisp lines.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-detail-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-detail-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid distorting shapes and cross-fading opacity.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-detail-dont.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-detail-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Consistency\n\nAnimate with a consistency of motion both systematically and specifically.\n\nMaking broad, consistent choices defines a framework for how we present\ninformation and make it understood, especially in more technical scenarios.\nSeemingly inconsequential distinctions, like which direction elements move in\nand out of frame or how crossfades and type behave, are foundational to creating\na sense of reason and purpose.\n\nIn more illustrative scenarios, consistency can help demonstrate the role and\nfunction of abstract elements or define a baseline of behavior against which\nabrupt changes and influences become more noticeable. Setting expectations and,\nin some cases, subverting them is an excellent way to convey novel cause and\neffect, and imbue even simple forms with personality.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Reward expectations through consistent choices.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-consistency-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-consistency-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid the misinterpretation that can follow capricious movement.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" caption=\"Avoid the misinterpretation that can follow capricious movement.\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-consistency-dont.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-consistency-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Personality\n\nOur animations should always seek a balance between natural and engineered in\ntone and behavior. Unless essential to the story, nothing should feel coldly\nmechanical or overtly organic—it’s both working in cooperation that imparts a\nsubtle, yet appreciable, personality.\n\n### Precision\n\nElements move decisively, efficiently and with purpose. Align to the grid. Snap\ninto place. Use momentum to instigate crisp transitions. While no single detail\nwill be immediately noticeable, this precision and attention to detail is\npalpable and felt when applied holistically.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"A clear intent and precise movements communicate purpose.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-precision-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-precision1.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid superfluous motion.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-precision-dont.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-precision2.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Rhythm\n\nEstablishing a sense of rhythm in motion is essential to well-paced and\nunderstandable animations–rarely does everything happen at once. No matter which\ntactic you use to choreograph action into sequences, they all contribute to an\nebb and flow of activity that creates a pleasing rhythm and allows the viewer a\nmental pause before continuing. Tactics can include translating objects along\nalready defined paths with slightly offset timings, showing deliberate moments\nof cause and effect or allowing elements to move purposefully and then rest.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n<GifPlayer className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-rhythm1.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-rhythm1.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<Caption>Achieve effective rhythm with staggered hero performances.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n<GifPlayer className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-rhythm2.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-rhythm2.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<Caption>\n  Offsetting similar actions by small increments can be effective.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Fluidity\n\nA well-animated object should feel effortless and elegant, with a fluidity to\nits motion—not in the path it takes, but the finesse with which it moves. Pay\nclose attention to how each attribute is animated and the transition between\nmovements.\n\nIn general, refrain from employing stepped, stilted or disorderly motion.\nTechnically, motion requires animating at or above 24 frames per second (FPS) to\nhelp ensure smooth performances.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Aim for smooth and seamless movements.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-fluidity-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-fluidity-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use a frame rate lower than 24 frames per second.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-fluidity-dont.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-fluidity-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Physicality\n\nWhen applied selectively, animation that feels physical is an incredibly\neffective means of adding interest and personality to your designs, whether\nthey’re overtly dimensional or recognizable elements, or simple graphic shapes.\n\n### Mass and momentum\n\nCharm and spirit can be produced through collisions, moments of friction and\nslides. However, be deliberate and considered when moving elements—avoid\ncartoonish overshoots and bounces.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-momentum.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-momentum.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Volume\n\nConsider what the element to be animated represents, especially in\nhigher-fidelity and dimensional executions. Intuitively, viewers expect things\nto behave as they do in reality; feathers shouldn’t fall like lead, stone\nshouldn’t stretch like rubber. Treating recognizable objects with a sense of\nstylized realism can be an effective way to create interest.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Use motion that underscores the object in reality.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-volume-do.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-volume-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<Caption></Caption>\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid motion that contradicts the object in reality.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-volume-dont.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-volume-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Structure\n\nAnimated illustrations inevitably fall into one of two categories—sequential or\nlooped. Although a technical specification, this distinction also helps to\ndefine how a message is structured.\n\n### Sequential\n\nSequential animations are intended to depict a sequence of events with\ndeliberate start points and endpoints—an A to B narrative. Whether they then\nsettle into a loop state or reset to begin again, sequential animations are\ntypically more anecdotal and linear in their message than loops.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-sequential-mobile.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-sequential-mobile.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"videos/animation/animation-tt-sequential-wide.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-sequential-wide.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<Caption>Sequential movement leads a viewer along a prescribed path.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Simple loops\n\nLoops continue in a usually seamless cycle and often only convey a singular idea\nor message. The loop may be a series of states aligned to one topic or an\noverall ambient effect that draws focus and sets a particular tone.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-simple-loop-mobile.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-simple-loop-mobile.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-simple-loop-wide.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-simple-loop-wide.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<Caption>Use simple loops to convey individual concepts.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Nested loops\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Offset loops to guide attention in sequence from region to region.\">\n<GifPlayer>\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-nested-loop-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-nested-loop-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid excessive overlaps in action.\">\n<GifPlayer>\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-nested-loop-dont.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-nested-loop-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Type\n\nType is an essential component of our communications. Accordingly, care must be\ntaken in animation to present type in a manner that's natural and understandable\nto our viewers.\n\n### Presentation\n\nWhether revealing a block of type as a whole or animating individual\nelements—line by line, word by word, even character by character—our approach to\ntype should reinforce the natural rhythm of reading, typically by appearing left\nto right, top to bottom. And, as with graphic elements, type should only be\nanimated on one axis at a time, and be left in the frame long enough to be\nlegible and comprehensible to the viewer.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Reveal type with orientation that supports comprehension.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-presentation-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-presentation-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid centered paragraphs and revealing type over multiple axes simultaneously.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer\n  src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-presentation-dont.json`)}\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-presentation-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Integrity\n\nThe IBM Plex® typeface is designed to be a representation of our brand, where\nevery detail reflects a decision made with purpose.

Setting expectations and,\nin some cases, subverting them is an excellent way to convey novel cause and\neffect, and imbue even simple forms with personality.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Reward expectations through consistent choices.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-consistency-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-consistency-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid the misinterpretation that can follow capricious movement.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" caption=\"Avoid the misinterpretation that can follow capricious movement.\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-consistency-dont.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-consistency-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Personality\n\nOur animations should always seek a balance between natural and engineered in\ntone and behavior. Unless essential to the story, nothing should feel coldly\nmechanical or overtly organic—it’s both working in cooperation that imparts a\nsubtle, yet appreciable, personality.\n\n### Precision\n\nElements move decisively, efficiently and with purpose. Align to the grid. Snap\ninto place. Use momentum to instigate crisp transitions. While no single detail\nwill be immediately noticeable, this precision and attention to detail is\npalpable and felt when applied holistically.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"A clear intent and precise movements communicate purpose.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-precision-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-precision1.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid superfluous motion.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-precision-dont.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-precision2.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Rhythm\n\nEstablishing a sense of rhythm in motion is essential to well-paced and\nunderstandable animations–rarely does everything happen at once. No matter which\ntactic you use to choreograph action into sequences, they all contribute to an\nebb and flow of activity that creates a pleasing rhythm and allows the viewer a\nmental pause before continuing. Tactics can include translating objects along\nalready defined paths with slightly offset timings, showing deliberate moments\nof cause and effect or allowing elements to move purposefully and then rest.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n<GifPlayer className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-rhythm1.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-rhythm1.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<Caption>Achieve effective rhythm with staggered hero performances.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n<GifPlayer className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-rhythm2.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-rhythm2.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<Caption>\n  Offsetting similar actions by small increments can be effective.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Fluidity\n\nA well-animated object should feel effortless and elegant, with a fluidity to\nits motion—not in the path it takes, but the finesse with which it moves. Pay\nclose attention to how each attribute is animated and the transition between\nmovements.\n\nIn general, refrain from employing stepped, stilted or disorderly motion.\nTechnically, motion requires animating at or above 24 frames per second (FPS) to\nhelp ensure smooth performances.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Aim for smooth and seamless movements.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-fluidity-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-fluidity-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use a frame rate lower than 24 frames per second.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-fluidity-dont.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-fluidity-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Physicality\n\nWhen applied selectively, animation that feels physical is an incredibly\neffective means of adding interest and personality to your designs, whether\nthey’re overtly dimensional or recognizable elements, or simple graphic shapes.\n\n### Mass and momentum\n\nCharm and spirit can be produced through collisions, moments of friction and\nslides. However, be deliberate and considered when moving elements—avoid\ncartoonish overshoots and bounces.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-momentum.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-momentum.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Volume\n\nConsider what the element to be animated represents, especially in\nhigher-fidelity and dimensional executions. Intuitively, viewers expect things\nto behave as they do in reality; feathers shouldn’t fall like lead, stone\nshouldn’t stretch like rubber. Treating recognizable objects with a sense of\nstylized realism can be an effective way to create interest.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Use motion that underscores the object in reality.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-volume-do.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-volume-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<Caption></Caption>\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid motion that contradicts the object in reality.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-volume-dont.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-volume-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Structure\n\nAnimated illustrations inevitably fall into one of two categories—sequential or\nlooped. Although a technical specification, this distinction also helps to\ndefine how a message is structured.\n\n### Sequential\n\nSequential animations are intended to depict a sequence of events with\ndeliberate start points and endpoints—an A to B narrative. Whether they then\nsettle into a loop state or reset to begin again, sequential animations are\ntypically more anecdotal and linear in their message than loops.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-sequential-mobile.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-sequential-mobile.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"videos/animation/animation-tt-sequential-wide.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-sequential-wide.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<Caption>Sequential movement leads a viewer along a prescribed path.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Simple loops\n\nLoops continue in a usually seamless cycle and often only convey a singular idea\nor message. The loop may be a series of states aligned to one topic or an\noverall ambient effect that draws focus and sets a particular tone.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-simple-loop-mobile.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-simple-loop-mobile.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/animation/animation-tt-simple-loop-wide.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-simple-loop-wide.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<Caption>Use simple loops to convey individual concepts.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Nested loops\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Offset loops to guide attention in sequence from region to region.\">\n<GifPlayer>\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-nested-loop-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-nested-loop-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid excessive overlaps in action.\">\n<GifPlayer>\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-nested-loop-dont.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-nested-loop-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Type\n\nType is an essential component of our communications. Accordingly, care must be\ntaken in animation to present type in a manner that's natural and understandable\nto our viewers.\n\n### Presentation\n\nWhether revealing a block of type as a whole or animating individual\nelements—line by line, word by word, even character by character—our approach to\ntype should reinforce the natural rhythm of reading, typically by appearing left\nto right, top to bottom. And, as with graphic elements, type should only be\nanimated on one axis at a time, and be left in the frame long enough to be\nlegible and comprehensible to the viewer.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Reveal type with orientation that supports comprehension.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-presentation-do.json`)} />\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-presentation-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid centered paragraphs and revealing type over multiple axes simultaneously.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n<LottiePlayer\n  src={import(`../../lottie/animation-tt-presentation-dont.json`)}\n/>\n\n![Animated illustration](./images/animation-tt-presentation-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer >\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Integrity\n\nThe IBM Plex® typeface is designed to be a representation of our brand, where\nevery detail reflects a decision made with purpose.
