In it you’ll find foundational grids for line style illustrations, guidance on the underlying anatomy of the style and a fundamental set of simple elements you can use or recombine to form your own new illustration narrative. The kit includes an inspiration gallery of examples showing techniques you can use in this style. These examples aren’t a library of ready-made art; they’re solely provided to help inform your explorations.

It’s all\nabout the precise nature of the line and its overall lightness. The lines\nprescribed in the system use a simple logic that works well with the\n[2x Grid](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/2x-grid) and helps maintain\nconsistency across the IBM brand.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![recommended line weights](./images/lines-mobile.png)\n![recommended line weights](./images/lines.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n### Mixing line weights\n\nMixing line wieghts in an illustration is acceptable as long as you don’t use\nweights that are too similar. It’s also recommended to use no more than four\nweights within a single illustration.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Do mix line weights that have clear purpose and distinction.\">\n\n![Mixing line weights do example](./images/mixing-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t mix line weights that are too similar.\">\n\n![Mixing line weights don't example](./images/mixing-dont.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Spacing\n\nIt’s very important to have the appropriate space between different line\nweights. Here's a guide to follow.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![line weights with recommended spacing](./images/spacing-mobile.png)\n![line weights with recommended spacing](./images/spacing.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Do use line spacing greater than or equal to the line weights being used.\">\n\n![line spacing do example](./images/spacing-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use line spacing smaller than the line weights being used.\">\n\n![line spacing don't example](./images/spacing-dont.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Grid\n\nBuilding off of the [2x Grid](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/2x-grid), the\nline style grid has been optimized to help craft engineered executions of line\nwork. Since line style illustrations may require very fine detail, a 4px grid\nsystem was chosen as the base unit. The 4px grid should be used for all canvas\nsizes. This method will ensure that your illustrations don’t become overly\ncrowded or busy.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![lines distributed properly on 2x Grid](./images/grid-mobile.png)\n![lines distributed properly on 2x Grid](./images/grid.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n### Snapping to grid\n\nLine style illustrations should be constructed using the “snap to grid” feature\nin Adobe Illustrator. This setting ensures that the points along your drawing\ncan snap to the grid lines underneath your line work. The grid positioning of\nthe line gives the precise and engineered aesthetic that’s vital to any IBM\nillustration.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Do make sure the anchor point lands clearly on intersecting grid lines.\">\n\n![anchor point correctly on grid](./images/snapping-do.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t forget to use “snap to grid,” or it may result in misaligned anchor points.\">\n\n![anchor point misaligned](./images/snapping-dont.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Drawing\n\nTo keep your illustrations following an engineered and simplified aesthetic,\nplease stay away from complex Bézier curves and arbitrary curvature unless the\nidea or metaphor requires it to communicate clearly. Angles, curves and rounded\ncorners should be built using the grid and basic geometries as much as possible.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![line drawing basics](./images/drawing-mobile.png)\n![line drawing basics](./images/drawing.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n### Angles\n\nPlease use standard angles—15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75° and 90° are preferred. Using\nthese standard angles will help your illustrations appear consistent. Although\nyou can use any angle, we recommend sticking with the standard angles suggested\nhere.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![recommend angles](./images/angles-mobile.svg)\n![recommend angles](./images/angles.svg)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n### Circular curves\n\nCreate curves using the grid as your guide and use quarter circles, semicircles\nand full circles whenever possible to achieve pure and simple curved shapes.\nFollowing this guidance will help ensure the engineered aesthetic.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![geometry behind circular curves](./images/curves-1.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![circular curves illustration example](./images/curves-2.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Do use clear and regular curves when possible.\">\n\n![regular curves example](./images/curves-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use irregular curves if they can be avoided.\">\n\n![irregular curves example](./images/curves-dont.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Organic curves\n\nOrganic Bézier curves may be used to add more realism and character to your\nillustration, but should be used intentionally and with precision. Basic shapes\nshould always lay the foundation and be used to ground the more irregular\ncurves.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![correct use of organic curves](./images/organic-curves-1.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![misuse of organic curves](./images/organic-curves-2.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Rounded corners and nesting\n\nYou can round the corners of angles in Adobe Illustrator for a fluid and\ncontrolled look. Here are some specifications to use when applying a radius to\nyour object.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![recommended rounded corner radii](./images/rounded-mobile.png)\n![recommended rounded corner radii](./images/rounded.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Do equally space nested lines with increasing radii.\">\n\n![nicely executed rounded corners](./images/rounded-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use different corner radii when nesting lines.\">\n\n![poorly executed rounded corners](./images/rounded-dont.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Color\n\nEach illustration style has a slightly different expression of color based on\nthe characteristics of the elements being used. Stroked lines, for example, have\nthe unique quality of allowing gradients and transparencies to follow the path\nof the stroke. For general approaches to color, please visit the illustration\n[tips and techniques](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/illustration/tips-and-techniques)\npage.\n\n### Gradients\n\nGradients can be an effective way of adding more fidelity to your linework by\nimplying depth, dimension and movement. For best results, apply the gradient so\nthat it follows the path of the stroke.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![gradient example 1](./images/gradient-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![gradient example 2](./images/gradient-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Transparency\n\nIn most cases, it’s recommended to use opaque lines and avoid the use of\nlighting effects, such as transparency and multiply. This technique helps ensure\nconsistent colors across all our illustrations. Transparency effects can still\nbe implied by carefully selecting sequential swatches from the palette or by\nusing gradients where one of the swatches blends into the background.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![transparency example 1](./images/transparency-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![transparency example 2](./images/transparency-2.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"3ce8002431ff9164cbe5b9e7c8ef6e44","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1701},"frontmatter":{"title":"Line style","description":"Line style illustrations use limited line weights and a small grid to convey concepts with precision and yet a wide latitude for expression.","tabs":["Design","Usage"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Line style\ndescription:\n  Line style illustrations use limited line weights and a small grid to convey\n  concepts with precision and yet a wide latitude for expression.\ntabs: [Design, Usage]\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nLine style is the most basic and immediate type of illustration at IBM.
