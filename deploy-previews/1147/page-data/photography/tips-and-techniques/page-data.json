This translates into\nthe perspectives we commonly use in photography. There are two primary\nviewpoints, each deliberately designed to present the world “as-is” and at its\nbeautiful best.\n\n### Eye level\n\nWe are a forward-facing organization. We treat our clients and ourselves as\nequals. Imagine IBM or an IBMer is the camera, this is how we view the world\naround us; authentically, eye-to-eye, fairly, naturally, truthfully. We take a\nstep back, capture context, observe the environment, and present a bigger\npicture.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![view down conveyor belt with food inspectors](./images/tips-and-techniques/eye-level-1.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![person crossing rainy city street](./images/tips-and-techniques/eye-level-2.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Aerial\n\nUsed less often, another angle we take is to offer things from a different\nperspective. Equally as objective, an aerial view allows us to “elevate” our\nobservations. This communicates a certain “eye” on consequences and impact at\nscale.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![top down view of equipment](./images/tips-and-techniques/aerial-1.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![aerial view of people on beach](./images/tips-and-techniques/aerial-2.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid forced perspectives that attempt to add interest to uninteresting subjects.\" colMd={3}>\n\n![avoid unusual perspectives](images/tips-and-techniques/aerial-dont-1.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid perspectives that are neither overhead or at natural eye-level.\" colMd={3}>\n\n![keep perspectives eye level or overhead](images/tips-and-techniques/aerial-dont-2.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Composition\n\nImage composition is the intentional arrangement of individual subjects within a\nscene to form the final image. There are two key aspects to composition that you\nshould consider for every image.\n\n### Framing\n\nThe 2x Grid can be a useful guide when thinking about composing imagery and\npositioning subjects. Images should leverage divisions of two. Either horizontal\nor vertical, these divisions create zones for subjects, allowing for carefully\nconsidered compositions that feel kinetic, like moments in time.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![vertical framing composition](./images/tips-and-techniques/framing-mobile-1.jpg)\n![vertical framing composition](./images/tips-and-techniques/framing-1.jpg)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<Caption>Vertical</Caption>\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![horizontal framing composition](./images/tips-and-techniques/framing-mobile-2.jpg)\n![horizontal framing composition](./images/tips-and-techniques/framing-2.jpg)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<Caption>Horizontal</Caption>\n\n### Focal points\n\nUse the 2x Grid to establish clear focal points. It may seem prescriptive, but\nwhen seen together this approach acts as connective tissue between IBM images.\nThe same approach is used to create delightful film experiences.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![focal points with a the 2x Grid first example](./images/tips-and-techniques/focal-mobile-1.jpg)\n![focal points with a the 2x Grid first example](./images/tips-and-techniques/focal-1.jpg)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![focal points with a the 2x Grid second example](./images/tips-and-techniques/focal-mobile-2.jpg)\n![focal points with a the 2x Grid second example](./images/tips-and-techniques/focal-2.jpg)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\n  type=\"dont\"\n  caption=\"Avoid having no center of interest and drawing attention to an empty center\" colMd={3}>\n\n![fill focal point center](./images/tips-and-techniques/focal-dont-1.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\n  type=\"dont\"\n  caption=\"Avoid conflicting focal points and no clear alignments to a grid\" colMd={3} >\n\n![choose one focal point and align to grid](./images/tips-and-techniques/focal-dont-2.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Aspect ratio\n\nWhen cropping images, use a common 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, 2:1 or 1:1 aspect ratio\nunless otherwise specified for a particular format. These common aspect ratios\nwork well with our 2x Grid foundation. They help create a visual rhythm within\neverything created using IBM Design Language—from UI components to signage,\nevent spaces and beyond.\n\n![aspect ratios example](./images/tips-and-techniques/aspect-ratios.png)\n\n## Lighting\n\nWhenever possible, use natural light or techniques that simulate natural light.\nIBM imagery is allergic to artificiality. The sincere portrayal of subject is\nparamount. We cannot manufacture a better reality than reality itself.\n\n![man putting bicycle up aerial view](./images/tips-and-techniques/light-1.jpg)\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\n  type=\"dont\"\n  caption=\"Avoid overly warm, glowing, or “golden hour” photographs\" colMd={3} >\n\n![avoid glowing photos](./images/tips-and-techniques/light-dont-1.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\n  type=\"dont\"\n  caption=\"Avoid color washes and grading\" colMd={3}>\n\n![avoid color washes](./images/tips-and-techniques/light-dont-2.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Depth-of-field\n\nEverything should be in sharp focus. This crisp approach reinforces a deep\ninterest in everything, and an emphasis on context and detail. Everything is\npresented evenly.\n\n![woman working in a wood shop](./images/tips-and-techniques/depth-1.jpg)\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\n  type=\"dont\"\n  caption=\"Avoid images with soft focus\" colMd={3} >\n\n![depth dont example](./images/tips-and-techniques/depth-dont-1.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\n  type=\"dont\"\n  caption=\"Avoid images that fall off focus too quickly\" colMd={3} >\n\n![depth dont example](./images/tips-and-techniques/depth-dont-2.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Effects and filters\n\nAvoid anything artificial. We’re a fact-based company. We communicate with\nclarity, and our photography should communicate this too. We avoid hyperbole and\njargon. Our imagery should avoid spin and overstyling as well.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\n  type=\"dont\"\n  caption=\"Avoid images with added glare or elements that have been clearly added via photoshop\" colMd={3} >\n\n![effects dont example](./images/tips-and-techniques/effects-dont-1.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\n  type=\"dont\"\n  caption=\"Avoid images that have color or image overlays\" colMd={3} >\n\n![effects dont example](./images/tips-and-techniques/effects-dont-2.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Clichés, metaphors & see-say\n\nWhen it comes to photography, people respond to what they don’t see as much as\nwhat they do see. Too often, imagery is used to double-down on what is already\nunderstood versus adding depth and dimension. We should use imagery\npurposefully, to expand ideas and elicit emotion.\n\nWe are a fact-based, insightful, opinionated organization. Therefore, we try to\navoid abstraction in favor of palatability and tangibility. If an image looks\nlike it could have been created by any other organization, it’s probably lacking\na distinct point-of-view (style or subject) or purposeful use that is uniquely\nIBM.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\n  type=\"dont\"\n  caption=\"Avoid cliché images that attempt to loosely represent a concept while not portraying the real world at work\" colMd={3} >\n\n![cliche dont example](./images/tips-and-techniques/cliche-dont-1.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\n  type=\"dont\"\n  caption=\"Avoid images that are both unrealistic and common\" colMd={3} >\n\n![cliche dont example](./images/tips-and-techniques/cliche-dont-2.jpg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5b21d8b6f73f6128fae4097a91102681","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1676},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tips and techniques","description":"When choosing or creating an IBM image, certain criteria should be considered.
