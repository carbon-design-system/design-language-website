Make your own! Follow these guidelines to ensure visual consistency and proper formatting.\n\n- All pictograms should be unique and not redundant with any existing pictograms in the system. Look through the pictograms in the [IBM Design Sketch kit](sketch://add-library/cloud/4f1cbe6c-6626-405e-8c46-a9ae41a30cba) to ensure that your proposed new pictogram is not already represented.\n- All pictograms should adhere to the [IBM Design Language visual style](/iconography/pictograms/design).\n- All pictograms should comply with IBM [accessibility standards](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview).\n- All pictograms should be usable across all supported platforms and devices.\n- All pictograms should be understandable by a global audience of users, regardless of nationality or language.\n\n## Producing an icon\n\n- Create a 32 x 32 px artboard for each pictogram.\n- 32 px pictograms should have 1 px padding.\n- Set your workspace up from the start to snap to grid.\n- Be aware of automatic alignments which can place vectors on uneven or half pixels.\n- The pictogram should be on the top-most layer in your artboard. Strokes should be grouped appropriately.\n- Make sure to properly name layers and artboards (these names will also be exported into the code).\n\n### Production-ready\n\n- To be considered production-ready, all pictogram submissions must be delivered in Adobe Illustrator format at 32 x 32 px with strokes kept intact.\n- Each artboard and the artwork within it must be aligned to the pixel grid wherever possible.\n- All strokes should be kept as is and not converted to shapes.\n- Group strokes logically whenever possible.\n\n## Exporting SVGs\n\n### Export SVGs from Sketch.\n\n1. Draw a 32 x 32 px artboard. 32 px pictograms should have 1 px padding.\n1. Place the pictogram squarely on the artboard, making sure it’s aligned to the pixel grid.\n1. Convert all strokes to outlines `Shift + ⌘ + O`.\n1. Select any overlapping shapes and click the `Union` icon from the top navigation to merge all of the shapes together.\n1. Make sure the icon is at `#000000` and has no additional styling.\n1. Select the entire artboard (not just the icon).\n1. Click `Make Exportable` at the bottom of the right toolbar in Sketch.\n1. In the `Export` widget select `SVG` in the format dropdown.\n1. Click `Export 'Artboard-Name'`.\n1. Name icon with the `#name--modifier` convention. (ex. copy.svg, copy—glyph.svg, add.svg, add—glyph.svg).\n\n### Export SVGs from Adobe Illustrator.\n\n1. Draw a 32 x 32 px artboard. 32 px pictograms should have 1 px padding.\n1. Place the icon squarely on the artboard, making sure it’s aligned to the pixel grid.\n1. Expand all strokes `Object > Expand`.\n1. Select all overlapping shapes and click the `Unite` icon in the `Pathfinder` panel to merge all of the shapes together.\n1. Make sure the icon is at `#000000` and has no additional styling.\n1. Select `File > Save a Copy…` from the top navigation.\n1. On the `Format` dropdown select `SVG`.\n1. Below `Format` select `Use Artboard`, then select either all or a range of artboards, depending on your need.\n1. Click `Save`.\n1. The `SVG Options` dialog will then open.\n1. Make sure the preferences are the same as in the image below.\n1.

If so, please consider contributing to the design system. IBM welcomes pictogram contributions in the form of a pull request to our pictogram repository. For now, to make a pull request, **[please submit an issue in the repo](https://github.ibm.com/brand/Pictograms/issues/new/choose)** with the pictogram attached.\n\nPlease note that Carbon contribution is **not required** in order to introduce a new pictogram into your materials. If your pictogram is determined to be broadly useful in Carbon and passes IBM Brand design reviews, then it may also be integrated into the design system.\n\nIf your submission is accepted, the team will notify you. If changes are needed, you’ll need to create a new contribution issue after reworking it based on feedback from the Design System and Brand teams.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"e283072dd17aaea58343bf8d26db4a36","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1693},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pictograms","description":"Pictograms are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or narratives at a glance.
