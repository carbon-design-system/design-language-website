Some are more\nliteral, some more abstract, some zoomed-in, some zoomed-out while others\nrequire more fidelity to capture and convey the details. Whatever the best\nstrategy, IBM illustration styles have been developed with this diversity in\nmind so that you can determine which approach best depicts the concepts or the\nnature of the subject.\n\n### Abstract and literal\n\nExpressing concepts in abstract ways creates interest and exciting compositions,\nwhile literal executions can communicate complicated concepts more clearly. Both\ntechniques are vital for communications with illustrations.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![abstract illustration example](./images/tips-and-techniques/abstract.png)\n\n<Caption>Abstraction is more conceptual and provocative.</Caption>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![literal illustration example](./images/tips-and-techniques/literal.png)\n\n<Caption>Literal expressions are more explanatory and utilitarian.</Caption>\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Micro and macro\n\nIBM has a long and rich history of showing systems in micro and macro scales.\nThis ability to communicate in both scales allows us to communicate the hard to\nsee or expansive concepts. These views are critical to illustration techniques\nand effectiveness.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![micro illustration example](./images/tips-and-techniques/micro.png)\n\n<Caption>Micro views zoom into the subject.</Caption>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![macro illustration example](./images/tips-and-techniques/macro.png)\n\n<Caption>Macro views show a larger picture.</Caption>\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Low fidelity and high fidelity\n\nSome illustrations benefit from being simple and direct while others require\nmore fidelity to capture greater detail or offer a dramatic effect. Illumination\nis always an idea to consider with color and detailing techniques, such as\ngradients, which can help communicate more vividly.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![low fidelity illustration example](./images/tips-and-techniques/lo-fidelity.png)\n\n<Caption>Solid color is more simple and direct.</Caption>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![high fidelity illustration example](./images/tips-and-techniques/high-fidelity.png)\n\n<Caption>Gradients and tone add depth and drama.</Caption>\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n## Intent\n\nKnowing the intent of your illustration helps create the framework for\ndecision-making. Will it serve as the cover of a brochure, a large wall at an\nevent or support a series of ideas in a website. Illustrations can live within a\nwide variety of sizes and environments whether digital or physical. There are\ndifferent types of illustrations used for various purposes at different scales\nand complexities.\n\n### Featured\n\nFeatured, or hero, illustrations are impactful. These delightful illustrations\ntell complex stories. Hero illustrations tend to be more metaphorical and\nintricate than other types of imagery and may use more color, space and\nelements. While heros are more complex and imaginative, they should remain\nfocused and balanced. Maintaining a sense of professionalism and organization\nthrough thoughtful composition is key.\n\n![hero illustration in booklet](./images/tips-and-techniques/featured.png)\n\n### Supportive\n\nSupportive, or spot, illustrations are simplified illustrations that usually\nenhance other content. Because they are supporting elements, spot illustrations\nmust be easily read so viewers grasp concepts at glance. Spot illustrations are\nfocused, but maintain a feeling of delight and nimbleness, guiding a viewer\nthrough a narrative. Spot illustrations are commonly used in digital empty\nstates, in composition with other spot illustrations or paired with text.\n\n![supportive illustration on website](./images/tips-and-techniques/supportive.png)\n\n## Color\n\nColor in illustration sets the tone, gives meaning and reinforces our brand\nexpression. When choosing colors for your illustrations, consider their\nassociation with your particular product or communication. When chosen\nthoughfully, colors can achieve engaging and delightful results.\n\nThe starting point for illustrations should always be the\n[IBM color palette](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color). Adherence to\nthis palette creates brand consistency and distinction. When working on specific\nbusiness units within IBM, please reference the individual\n[brand guidelines](https://www.ibm.com/brand/systems) for more detailed color\nguidance.\n\n![color illustration with gradient](./images/tips-and-techniques/color.png)\n\n### Color schemes\n\nThere are many different ways to combine swatches from the IBM color palette,\ndepending on the style and intent of your illustration. Below are a few common\napproaches to consider.\n\n#### Monochromatic\n\nMonochromatic illustrations have a simple and direct quality to them and are\ncomprised of tints and tones of a single hue. This tehnique has a logical,\nsystematic and engineered look. Within this scheme, flat or tint techniques can\nbe applied.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![monochromatic illustration example 1](./images/tips-and-techniques/monochromatic-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![monochromatic illustration example 2](./images/tips-and-techniques/monochromatic-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![monochromatic illustration example 3](./images/tips-and-techniques/monochromatic-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Analogous\n\nAnalogous colors bring a harmonious quality by using neighboring hues from the\npalette. This technique adds subtle depth, movement and fidelity to an\nillustration. Two to three hues work best for this technique. Additional colors\nwill likely add unnecessary complexity and should be avoided.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![analogous illustration example 1](./images/tips-and-techniques/analogous-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![analogous illustration example 2](./images/tips-and-techniques/analogous-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![analogous illustration example 3](./images/tips-and-techniques/analogous-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Complementary\n\nThe opposing nature of complementary colors create vibrancy and tension, which\ncan be quite effective when you want to draw attention to an element. Large\nfields of complementary colors can be quite jarring, so it’s best to use them as\naccents that bring just the right amount of contrast and life to an\nillustration.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![complementary illustration example 1](./images/tips-and-techniques/complementary-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![complementary illustration example 2](./images/tips-and-techniques/complementary-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![complementary illustration example 3](./images/tips-and-techniques/complementary-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Use of blue\n\nBe cautious when using blues in an illustration that could potentially compete\nwith other elements that are also blue, such as UI buttons and other focal\npoints.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Do choose colors that maintain clear delineation around focal points.\">\n\n![example of clearly delineated elements](./images/tips-and-techniques/cta-1.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use an abundance of blue that may obscure important UI elements.\">\n\n![example of an overuse of blue](./images/tips-and-techniques/cta-2.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Additional colors\n\nIn some cases, additional colors will be required to achieve a more realistic\nillustration. In general, orange and yellow tones are reserved for UI alert\ncolors, but may be used, if required. Additional colors should be limited to\nspecific use cases, such as skin tones.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Specific blends of IBM red and green swatches may be used for skin tones.\">\n\n![illustration with skin tone](./images/tips-and-techniques/add-color-1.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Yellow is not required to represent the pencil and should be avoided in this case.\">\n\n![illustration with yellow pencil](./images/tips-and-techniques/add-color-2.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Accessibility\n\nIBM firmly believes that all of our experiences should be accessible for\neveryone, regardless of abilities or impairments. If an illustration conveys\ninformation not entirely captured in accompanying text, the main concepts must\nmeet [3:1 AA accessibility](https://link) standards. Always be conscious when\nchoosing colors to give every user the same experience, regardless of ability.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Colors pass with 3.9:1 contrast ratio.\">\n\n![illustration with sufficient contrast ratio](./images/tips-and-techniques/accessibility-1.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Colors fail with 2.1:1 contrast ratio.\">\n\n![illustration with insufficient contrast ratio](./images/tips-and-techniques/accessibility-2.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Canvases\n\nUse common aspect ratios, such as 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, 2:1 and 1:1, for illustrations\nunless otherwise dictated by specific platform requirements. These helpful\naspect ratios also correspond well to the resolution, scale and line weights.\nThese common aspect ratios work well with our 2x Grid, creating a visual rhythm\nacross everything created using IBM Design Language, from our components and\nformats to signage and event spaces and more.\n\n![aspect ratios for illustration](./images/tips-and-techniques/canvases.svg)\n\n## Composition\n\nIBM has very specific guidance around composition. The following tips show how\nto best compose your ideas into distinct and successful illustrations. Visit\n[IDL Layout guidance](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/layout/overview) for\nmore detailed information about composition.\n\n### Framing\n\nThe [2x Grid](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/2x-grid) can be a useful guide\nwhen composing illustrations. Images should leverage divisions of two. Either\nhorizontal or vertical, these divisions create zones for different kinds of\nrepresentations. For example, one area could show a literal object while the\nadjacent area could reveal what’s happening digitally or behind the scenes.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![illustration with two sides](./images/tips-and-techniques/framing-mobile-1.png)\n![illustration with two sides](./images/tips-and-techniques/framing-1.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<Caption>Two sides</Caption>\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![illustration with clear horizons](./images/tips-and-techniques/framing-mobile-2.png)\n![illustration with clear horizons](./images/tips-and-techniques/framing-2.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<Caption>Horizons</Caption>\n\n### Focal points\n\nUse the [2x Grid](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/2x-grid) to establish\nclear focal points. It may seem prescriptive, but when seen together, this\napproach acts as connective tissue between IBM illustrations. The same approach\nis used to create delightful animated experiences.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![illustration with offset focal point](./images/tips-and-techniques/focal-mobile-1.png)\n![illustration with offset focal point](./images/tips-and-techniques/focal-1.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![illustration with centered focal point](./images/tips-and-techniques/focal-mobile-2.png)\n![illustration with centered focal point](./images/tips-and-techniques/focal-2.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"9ac0cbac44ddc3d7fee60ebd54b4fccc","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1665},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tips and techniques","description":"Illustrations can move a viewer from one point of view to another instantly.
