Every element we set in motion is an extension of our voice—it must\nserve a purpose, embody precision and communicate clearly. No matter the format\nor subject matter, these themes are universal when correctly capturing our tone\nand approach to motion.\n\n<!-- Container div for margin-top spacing -->\n\n<div>\n<Row class=\"narrativeTable\">\n\n<Column colLg={4} noGutter>\n\n### Effective\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={8} noGutter>\n\nAnimation at IBM amplifies the meaning inherent in any design. It doesn’t\nobscure or distract. Motion is uniquely effective in its capacity to explain\nideas sequentially and rapidly refocus on what’s important. Endeavor to capture\nattention through action, demonstrate function and process with compelling\nperformances, and break down complex ideas into digestible steps that\nprogressively build toward understanding.\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n<Row class=\"narrativeTable\">\n\n<Column colLg={4} noGutter>\n\n### Concise\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={8} noGutter>\n\nConsider the scope of your story. Define the message and craft your animation to\nbe straightforward and succinct in how it conveys that message.

Needless flourishes or overcomplicated actions\nwithout clear reason have no place in our animations.

This meticulous attention to detail is vital to establishing a\nconsistent attitude and tone of motion in everything we create.\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n</div>\n\n## Productive and expressive\n\nOur approach to animation is guided by two essential types of motion: productive\nand expressive. The distinct impression created by each type offers a clear\nmeans of creating contrast, but also a sense of cooperation—man and machine,\norganic and engineered.\n\n<Video poster={poster} src=\"/videos/animation/animation-overview-pe.mp4\" />\n\n### Types\n\nProductive and expressive motion each evoke a particular tone that’s\nidentifiably IBM:\n\n– &nbsp;&nbsp;_Productive_ motion leans toward efficiency and\nresponsiveness.<br/> – &nbsp;&nbsp;_Expressive_ motion is enthusiastic and\nvibrant.\n\nWhile there are countless ways to interpret and depict either type, they also\nserve as the foundation of an animation vocabulary, a shorthand to describe how\nan object should move, the feeling it should evoke.\n\nWhile there’s no specific formula for creating motion, it’s the rationale behind\nchoosing to apply each type that’s important. Each type on its own is useful,\nbut they’re greater together.\n\n### Harmony\n\nOur animation is at its best when the conversation between productive and\nexpressive motion is clearly apparent. Each type has an important role to play\nin a piece, and the energy between the two provide a compelling contrast,\nbringing a nuanced personality to each element in motion.\n\nBeyond how each individual element is influenced by either type—or the interplay\nbetween them—every piece of animation can similarly benefit by being weighted\ntoward either productive or expressive motion as a whole.\n\n### Tone\n\nUsing either productive or expressive motion alone will inherently create\ndifferent impressions. For example, productive elements may appear professional,\nconfident, smart and efficient, while expressive elements may evoke more\npersonality and emotion.\n\nThinking in expressive and productive terms opens a broad range of tone. Our\nmotion toolbox can evoke everything from cheerful and lighthearted to forthright\nand reserved while steering clear of the silly or overly dramatic.\n\n## Applications\n\nAnimation can help recognize moments throughout the user interface experience.\nFor example, you might use productive motion to confirm completion of tasks, or\nexpressive motion to mark the beginning of a process. Animation can help guide\nusers through complex experiences, or highlight progress through a process.\n\n### Illustration\n\n<Row>\n\n<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>\n\n![Watson illustration](./images/overview/animation-illustration.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Line style\"\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/design/language/illustration/line-style/usage#animation\"\n      actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n      >\n\n![Bee Icon](../../images/resource-cards/bee.png)\n\n</ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Flat style\"\n      actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/design/language/illustration/flat-style/usage#animation\"\n      >\n\n![Bee Icon](../../images/resource-cards/bee.png)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Isometric style\"\n      actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/design/language/illustration/isometric-style/usage#animation\"\n      >\n\n![Bee Icon](../../images/resource-cards/bee.png)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### User interface\n\nOur point of view can be applied to any narrative in every style; from simple to\ncomplex, ambient loop to feature brand film.\n\n<Row className=\"gallery-row-padding\">\n\n<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>\n\n![Watson user interface](./images/overview/animation-watson-demo.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Motion in UI\"\n    href=\"https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/motion/overview\"\n    >\n\n![carbon Icon](../../images/resource-cards/carbon.png)\n\n</ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"3190ff7bf28da9889ec4ae9ee4b69222","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1710},"frontmatter":{"title":"Overview","description":"Animation is a powerful communication tool.
