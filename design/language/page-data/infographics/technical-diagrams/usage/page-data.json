These guidelines were developed to help, as well as ensure brand consistency. Try to follow them as closely as possible. Depending on the tools used to create diagrams, there may be certain limitations, however clarity should never be sacrificed.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" aspectRatio=\"1:1\" caption=\"Always add a legend to your diagram, showing the color, line, style and shape conventions used.\">\n\n![Always add a legend to your diagram, showing the color, line, style and shape conventions used.](./images/usage/clarity/dodont1.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" aspectRatio=\"1:1\" caption=\"Don’t use icons by themselves to represent essential information—always use words, as well.\">\n\n![Don’t use icons by themselves to represent essential information—always use words, as well.](./images/usage/clarity/dodont2.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" aspectRatio=\"1:1\" caption=\"When a diagram can’t be displayed at 100% scale, offer the user a way to download it or zoom in.\">\n\n![When a diagram can’t be displayed at 100% scale, offer the user a way to download it or zoom in.](./images/usage/clarity/dodont3.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" aspectRatio=\"1:1\" caption=\"Alternate background fill colors to improve nesting readability.\">\n\n![Alternate background fill colors to improve nesting readability.](./images/usage/clarity/dodont4.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" aspectRatio=\"1:1\" caption=\"Avoid redundancy when using shapes, styles, colors or indicator badges.\">\n\n![Avoid redundancy when using shapes, styles, colors or indicator badges.](./images/usage/clarity/dodont5.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" aspectRatio=\"1:1\" caption=\"Don’t mix types of nodes unless they have specific semantic differences that can’t be expressed otherwise.\">\n\n![Don’t mix types of nodes unless they have specific semantic differences that can’t be expressed otherwise.](./images/usage/clarity/dodont6.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Carbon\n\nThe technical diagrams guidance presented here is meant for diagrams that appear outside of product screens, such as those found in documentation websites, in presentations, on collateral and so on. When creating a technical diagram as part of a product, use the Carbon components and Carbon for IBM Products guidance instead. \n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n<ResourceCard\n  subTitle=\"Carbon network diagrams\"\n  href=\"https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/complex-charts/#network-diagrams\"\n  actionIcon=\"launch\"\n>\n\n![Carbon](../../../images/resource-cards/carbon.png)\n\n</ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n<ResourceCard\n  subTitle=\"Carbon tree diagrams\"\n  href=\"https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/complex-charts/#tree-diagrams\"\n  actionIcon=\"launch\"\n>\n\n![Carbon](../../../images/resource-cards/carbon.png)\n\n</ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n<ResourceCard\n  subTitle=\"Carbon for IBM Products guidance (w3id required)\"\n  href=\"https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/canvas/usage\"\n  actionIcon=\"launch\"\n>\n\n![Carbon](../../../images/resource-cards/carbon.png)\n\n</ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Subsystems\n\nUsing our technical diagram guidance as a foundation, some teams have expanded on our system. They’ve built a number of discrete extensions, effectively creating subsystems that specifically address their exact use cases. If you work with one of these subsystems, follow our general guidance, as well as the specific adaptations applicable to your use case. If you believe you have an application that requires new elements, reach out to the IBM brand design team with your proposal for approval. It helps ensure that your technical diagram subsystem adheres to our general guidance, and gives us the opportunity to share it here with all teams.\n\n### IT architecture\n\n[The IBM Unified Method Framework](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-architect-profession/education#Architectural_Thinking) is the modelling standard used by IBM for IT architecture. When creating an IT architecture diagram, follow the visual guidance developed specifically for this type of diagram. Doing so helps ensure correct interpretation of your architectural model.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n<ResourceCard\n  subTitle=\"IT architecture visualization techniques (w3id required)\"\n  href=\"https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/it-architecture-visualization-techniques\"\n  actionIcon=\"launch\"\n>\n\n</ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n<ResourceCard\n  subTitle=\"Cognitive Architect\"\n  href=\"http://ibm.biz/cogarch-app\"\n  actionIcon=\"launch\"\n>\n\n</ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n<ResourceCard\n  subTitle=\"diagrams.net (desktop build)\"\n  href=\"https://github.com/IBM/it-architecture-diagrams\"\n  actionIcon=\"launch\"\n>\n\n![Draw.io](../../../images/resource-cards/drawio.png)\n\n</ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n<ResourceCard\n  download\n  subTitle=\"IT architecture diagrams starter kit\"\n  href=\"/files/IT-architecture-diagrams-kit_v1.ai\"\n  actionIcon=\"download\"\n>\n\n![Adobe Illustrator](../../../images/resource-cards/illustrator.png)\n\n</ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Product documentation\n\nAll products created by IBM have some related documentation. Often, this documentation includes various types of technical diagrams, such as flows, process diagrams, network diagrams and so on. Whenever you need to create a diagram representing a system of parts and the relationship between them, start from our general technical diagrams guidance. Various teams have developed subsystems tailored to their specific applications.
