This color pallette\napplies to data visualization, as well, but isn’t restricted to appearance only;\nit decreases recognition times, conveys meaning and helps users make faster,\nmore informed decisions. When designing IBM’s data visualization, be sure to\nmaximize accessibility and harmony, but also keep an eye on cultural and\npsychological contexts.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n<ResourceCard\nsubTitle=\"Data visualization color palette\"\nhref=\"https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/color-palettes/\"\nactionIcon=\"launch\"\n>\n\n\n![Carbon Icon](../../../images/resource-cards/carbon.png)\n\n</ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"IBM color palette (.ase and .clr)\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/raw/master/packages/colors/artifacts/IBM_Colors.zip\"\n      actionIcon=\"download\"\n      >\n\n\n![Bee Icon](../../../images/resource-cards/zip.png)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n\n#### Emphasize the story you want to tell\n\nColor is one of the most powerful sensory cues and a highly influential visual\nproperty. Create a sharp contrast between elements to focus the user's attention\non the meaning of the chart, but be essential—every color should have a reason\nfor being there. Conversely, even the absence of color delivers information.\n\nShades of grey ensure data points are visible while not distracting from the key\ninsights. On the other hand, connecting specific colors to certain key metrics\nhelps your audience easily recognize frequent indicators.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>\n\n\n![Conversion rate overtime](/images/Basics/color/conversion_rate.svg)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n\n#### Improve readability and hierarchy of elements\n\nCaring about contrast means caring if users will be able to read your chart on\ntheir screens, even in low light and if you use shades of colors like light\ngrey. Well-chosen colors reduce the time for viewers to gain insights and help\nthem understand the message sooner. Rely on categorical palettes if you want to\nmaximize contrast between data that doesn’t have an inherent relationship, while\nsequential palettes are good to show relationships or hierarchies between data.\nReinforce color meaning with other strong visual features, like shape, line or\npattern, to make the focal point immediately recognizable.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>\n\n\n![Monthly visitors](/images/Basics/color/monthly_visitors.svg)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n\n#### Represent quantity\n\nColor can convey meaning.

IBM employs different shades of black, together with patterns and\nmarkers, as a valid substitute for color. Patterns aren’t just a decoration, but\nbecome a way to convey information.

We use data visualization to communicate relationships between\nelements and make changes in the data set or on the environment explicit, clear\nand unambiguous. Consider the entrance and exit motions to enhance the visual\nhierarchy of elements, orientation of axes and the data displayed.
