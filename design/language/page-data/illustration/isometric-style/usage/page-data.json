The\nillusion of depth opens up a wealth of new storytelling options, but care must\nbe taken to maintain perspective, and animate with a more physical sense of\ncause and effect.\n\n<GifPlayer className=\"video-player video-player__gray\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/usage-hero.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![isometric illustration animation](../images/usage-hero.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n#### Tips\n\n- Maintain perspective when animating forms that are extruded or otherwise\n  depict volume in the original design.\n- Use rotation selectively as a way to add interest, delight or highlight\n  elements of significance.\n- Animate to convey weight, mass and precision to emphasize and support the\n  physical, volumetric nature of the style.\n- Ensure that shadows accurately react to the movement of the objects casting\n  them.\n\n### Maintaining perspective\n\n#### Translation\n\nIt's incredibly important to follow the IBM isometric grid in animation,\nespecially when moving objects in space. Objects that don’t behave in accordance\nwith the 30° incremental angles of their construction immediately break the\nillusion of space in this style—elements moving in arcs or diagonally will\nquickly break the illusion of space and depth.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Translate objects along the isometric grid on one axis at a time.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/translation-do.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Translation do](../images/translation-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid overlapping movement on multiple axes simultainiously.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/translation-dont.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Translation don't](../images/translation-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n  \n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Rotation\n\nRotation can be selectively added to individual elements as an avenue to create\ndelight or add interest. However, rotation should only be used if it adheres to\nthe same rules as 2D objects, applying it to one axis at a time with little to\nno overlap.\n\nThe animation of each element should typically be treated as you would a purely\n2D object, although some designs may lend themselves to more subtly volumetric\nand complex animations, such as simple rotations and oscillations.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Keep rotation to one axis at a time.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/rotation-do.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Rotation do](../images/rotation-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid overlapping rotation on multiple axes simultainiously.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/rotation-dont.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Rotation don't](../images/rotation-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n  \n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Camera\n\nMaintaining the angle of view in an isometric world is extremely important. As\nsuch, the camera should remain locked in place at all times, to not break\nperspective. Only on very rare occasions should the construction of a scene\naccommodate highly controlled, systematic repositioning of the camera.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Lock the camera to an isometric angle.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/camera-do.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Camera do](../images/camera-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid changes in perspective.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/camera-dont.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Camera don't](../images/camera-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n  \n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Light, shadow and gradient\n\nLight, shadow and gradient—where possible—should be defined in 2D, not baked\nonto 3D surfaces as textures. If more complex objects are required, creating\nmattes in a 3D package to accurately depict rotation on an object is the\npreferred technique for elements that are brought into a 2D package for\nanimation.\n\nEven though it presents the illusion of a third dimension, isometric style is\nstill typically produced in 2D and should be treated as such in motion. Animate\nthe movement and rotation, and their corresponding shadows, as you would 2D\nshapes.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Add color and gradients in 2D.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/light-do.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Lighting do](../images/rotation-do.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Avoid baking gradients on surfaces in 3D.\">\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\" className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  autoPlay\n  playsInline\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/light-dont.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Lighting don't](../images/rotation-dont.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</DoDont>\n  \n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Physicality\n\nThe introduction of volume creates a whole new avenue to create interest.\nHowever, achieving compelling performances in this perspective requires a\ngreater emphasis on physically believable motion.
