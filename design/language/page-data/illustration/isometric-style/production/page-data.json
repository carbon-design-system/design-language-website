Here are a few workspace specifications that makes it easier to\nalign your artwork properly to the grid.\n\n- Turn on snap to point.\n- Turn off snap to grid and snap to pixel.\n- Under `(Illustrator > Preferences)`, use the following specifications for\n  Smart Guides:\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>\n\n![Illustrator preferences for Smart Guides](/images/WorkspaceSetup.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n## Creating perspective\n\nPerspective can be simulated with simple, rectilinear shapes built on the\nisometric grid. However, more complex objects, such as circles and 2D content on\nsurfaces, can require additional techniques. Here are some ways to transform\nobjects and create perspective.\n\n### Automated object transformations\n\n1. Download the isometric style starter kit (coming soon).\n2. Double-click the `Isometric Transformations.aia` file to install the Adobe\n   Illustrator actions.\n3. Open the Actions palette by navigating to `(Window > Actions)`.\n4. Place any 2D object that you want to transform into a square or rectangle.\n   The dimensions of the bounding square or rectangle should be multiples of 8px\n   so that it will snap to the grid once transformed.\n5. Select the desired transformation from the Actions menu and click Play.\n\n### Manual object transformations\n\n1. Place any 2D object that you want to transform into a square or rectangle.\n   The dimensions of the bounding square or rectangle should be multiples of 8px\n   so that it will snap to the grid once transformed.\n2. Perform the transformations `Scale`, `Shear`, and `Rotate` located in the\n   `(Object > Transform)` menu. Use the settings in the table below.\n\n| Direction    | Vertical scale | Shear | Rotate |\n| ------------ | -------------- | ----- | ------ |\n| Left-facing  | 86.6%          | -30°  | -30°   |\n| Top-facing   | 86.6%          | 30°   | -30°   |\n| Right-facing | 86.6%          | 30°   | 30°    |\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![2d object before transformation](/images/Perspective1.svg)\n\n<Caption>Before</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Isometric object after transformation](/images/Perspective2.svg)\n\n<Caption>After (left-facing)</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### 3D effects\n\nIn most cases, we recommend against using Adobe Illustrator’s 3D effects. The\nreason is that the 3D effects can yield unexpected results, or objects that\ndon’t easily adhere to the grid. However, some objects may require 3D effects,\nsuch as Revolve and 3D Extrude & Bevel.\n\n1. Select the 2D object to which you will apply 3D effects.\n2. Navigate to `(Effect > 3D)` and choose a 3D effect.\n3. In the 3D effect options, choose one of the isometric settings for the\n   `Position` dropdown.\n4. In the `Surface` dropdown, choose No Shading .\n5. Expand the object with `(Object > Expand Appearance)` .\n6. Apply your own shading using colors from the [IBM color palette](/color).\n\n## Rounded objects and depth\n\nSimulating dimension with rectilinear objects is rather straightforward, but\nobjects with rounded edges can be tricky. Any rounded object, whether it's a\nrounded rectangle or a circle, can be constructed using cylinders. From there,\nit is easy to combine cylinders with rectangular prisms to make rounded\nrectangles with depth.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Wireframe rounded object](/images/RoundedObjects1.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Rendered rounded object](/images/RoundedObjects2.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Drawing a cylinder\n\n1. Draw a circle and square with the same dimensions. The dimensions should be\n   multiples of 8px so that it will snap to the grid once transformed.\n2. Draw an “X” over the bounding square.\n3. Group the objects and transform them in the desired direction.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Step 2](/images/Step3_1.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Step 3](/images/Step3_2.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n4. Copy the transformed object and paste it along the grid in the direction of\n   of the depth.\n5. With the Pen Tool, draw a polygon connecting the intersections of the circles\n   and the diagonal lines.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Step 4](/images/Step5_1.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Step 5 detail](/images/Step5_2.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Step 5](/images/Step5_3.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n6. Copy the circle on the surface.\n7. Select both circles and the polygon and `Add` them together using the\n   `(Window > Pathfinder)` palette.\n8. Paste the circle in place with `(Edit > Paste in place)`.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Step 7](/images/Step8_1.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Step 8](/images/Step8_2.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n## Animation workspace setup\n\nThe isometric grid behaves differently than the Adobe grids you may be used to.\nA complete guide on how to work with isometric illustrations in Adobe\nIllustrator can be found on the\n[Isometric style design page](/illustration/isometric-style/design/). Additional\nsetup tips and tricks can be found below.\n\n### Planes and flat surfaces\n\nElements that appear to be volumetric should generally be treated as flat\nillustrations in Adobe After Effects, while planes and elements constructed from\nflat surfaces can be made with 3D layers. To match the isometric grid, the\nfollowing camera settings can be used. Linking up the z-position to the negative\nzoom value allows you to use a very long lens to flatten the perspective.\n\nWhen making elements in 3D software outside of After Effects, please change the\ncamera settings to isometric.\n\nAfter Effects Specifications:\n\n| Null object | Position | Rotation | Scale |\n| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ----- |\n|             | 0.00     | 45°      | 100%  |\n|             | 0.00     | 35.264°  | 100%  |\n|             | 0.00     | 30°      | 100%  |\n\n<div className=\"top-margin-3rem\">\n\n| Camera      | Position             | Rotation | Scale |\n| ----------- | -------------------- | -------- | ----- |\n|             | 0.00                 | 0°       | 100%  |\n|             | 0.00                 | 0°       | 100%  |\n|             | -(cameraOption.zoom) | 0°       | 100%  |\n| Camera zoom | 50,000               |          |       |\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"top-margin-3rem\">\n\n![After Effects settings](/images/After_Effects_settings.png)\n\n</div>\n\n### Light and shadow\n\nColor and gradients help define the depth, volume and overall look of the\nisometric style. It’s important to keep in mind how physical light works and\nensure that your shadows behave accordingly.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"a498c2327ca08b20a973fadd411604c8","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1673},"frontmatter":{"title":"Isometric style","description":"Isometric style illustrations have unique properties and can sometimes be difficult to achieve.
