## Illustration guidance

We are currently working hard to create pages with our illustration principles, guidance and useful downloadable master files for several styles. The pages will also have great visual examples that exemplify and communicate all the principles and best practices that make great illustrations.

Expected in Q1 2020

## IBM Plex Korean (Hangul)

For the last year we’ve been working on the CJK (Chinese Japanese Korean) version of IBM Plex and we’re expecting to release IBM Plex Sans Korean in Q1 2020. We’re excited about the whole set and look forward to making this available in the new year!

Expected in Q1 2020

Guidance for the new IDL email layouts is progressing in tandem with the design of the system. The page will be a comprehensive reference for anyone intending to craft an email using WCA or other accepted email marketing platforms.
