Usable data is a central value IBM provides to our customers.

Now the IBM Design Language provides a distinctive rationale for visual representation of the IBM brand. Use this new guidance to create on-brand [data visualization] (https://www.ibm.com/design/language/datavisualization/overview) with impact.<br/>— <br/>5 March, 2020
