We have a new library with over 400 pictograms available to use and even more to come in the next release. Along with the library comes an available adobe illustrator master file with all the pictograms organized by category. This library and master file will serve as the single source of truth representing the latest and approved pictograms. If you need pictograms or want to contribute, please follow the guidance outlines [here](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/elements/pictograms/contribute) and check out the [library](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/elements/pictogram-library/).<br/>— <br/>9 October, 2019

We’re pleased to announce the new IBM Design Language V2 color palette. The updates from V1 are quite subtle at first glance but incorporate significant refinements when considering contrast ratios and accessibility for digital screens and interfaces. For an in depth article outlining the methodology and process please visit [Because, colors are beautiful](https://medium.com/carbondesign/because-colors-are-beautiful-52dd4cc39f09), and find the details on our [color page in IDL](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/raw/master/packages/colors/artifacts/IBM_Colors.zip).

    <li>4.5:1 contrast ratio between 50/90, 40/80, 30/70, 20/60</li>
    <li>slight hue enhancements to the magentas to be more distinct from the reds</li>
    <li>hues across each color have been smoothed out for more consistency</li>
