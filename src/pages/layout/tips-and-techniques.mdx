<PageDescription>

Layout creates a context for communication on a page. Using the right
composition helps guide a user through content in meaningful, useful and
beautiful ways. The tips and techniques found here can help you organize and
manipulate content for a successful user experience.

## Make and break patterns

In many ways, composition in design is very similar to musical composition.
Melody, rhythm, harmony, timbre, and form—among others—are principles that can
be translated across both fields. Like music, design is also driven by a careful
balance of repetition and variation to create unity and interest.

Is it too repetitive and predictable? Is it too chaotic and lacking in
structure? How do the elements relate to each other as well as the surrounding
space?

Logical repetition of elements, measurements, shapes, ratios, and proportions
will drive consistency and quality. Expressive variation—where appropriate—can
break expectations and create visual interest.

### Structural rhythm

When it comes to rhythm, what’s not on the page is just as important as what is.
Consider a measure of music; repetition of notes without structure does not
provide good rhythm. However, once notes are placed at regular time intervals,
rhythm emerges.

#### 2x Grid

[The 2x Grid](/elements/2x-grid) is the scaffolding on which IBM designers
create structural rhythm. It provides structural, proportional, and spatial
guidance for design within any media. Skillful use of it will yield harmonious
spatial relationships between canvas and content while expressing our distinct
point-of-view.

#### Sizing scale

In lieu of concrete vertical divisions, such as on a web page, the
[sizing scale](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/layout#sizing-scale)
is helpful in establishing vertical rhythm. Like a type scale, the sizing scale
constrains the range of sizes to improve consistency and rhythm, while still
allowing a wide range of sizes.

### Editorial rhythm

Careful repetition and alternation of larger units of design drives editorial
rhythm. This is most often done in multi-page editorial design or scrolling web
pages, where the viewer experiences one part of the whole at a time.

The concept is well established in music as form. Musical form describes the
structure of a piece of music as a combination of units. Letters are given to
the first occurrence of each unit, and the same letter is given to repeated
units. In the AABA form for example, A units have similar melodic content as
repeated A units, while the B unit offers an alternation to the A units to
provide interest.

In design, larger visual units are driven by the content. Similar types of
content can be given similar structure, such as the the same spatial dimensions,
type sizes and hierarchy, and alignments. Consider how units can be repeated,
and conversely, how structurally different units can break up the monotony of
repeated ones. Repetition of units across multiple designs drives continuity
between them.

## Let it breathe

A classic offense that plagues many designers and non-designers alike is the
overabundance of elements in a design. While utilizing all available space may
reduce canvas size or scroll distance, it does more harm than good when it comes
to a viewer's understanding of information. Overcrowding will render your design
impenetrable.

White space creates a visual pause between elements where the eye can rest. It
sets things apart or brings them together to distinguish an element’s importance
or priority. White space makes a layout feel clean and approachable while
maintaining content-rich design.

## Guide the eye

Design is successful when the viewer is guided through a composition via
hierarchy. Proper hierarchy creates visual entry points to a design and guides
the eye from one element to another in order of significance. Without it, one is
forced to discern importance among equally-weighted elements, which leads to a
flat design and poor experience.

### Hierarchy of information

Typographic hierarchy is the navigational system that renders complex
information accessible. Think of a book outline; the size, style, and position
of type not only informs what order it should be read, but also describes the
parent-child relationships of the content. Effective use of the
[type scale](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/elements/type-specs-ui), along
with an understanding of
[Gestalt principles](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles),
will ensure your design can be easily navigated and understood.

### Compositional flow

Facilitating eye movement through the composition creates a more interesting
design. A focal point instantly attracts the eye to one area of the canvas.
Secondary and tertiary elements then draw the eye across the canvas, creating
more engagement between the viewer and the design. This is done best through
[asymmetric layouts](/elements/layout/tips-and-techniques/#master-asymmetry),
where thoughtful relationships between elements make for a more visually
stimulating design. It's important to plan the movement of the eye in order to
guide the viewer to the intended outcome.

## Master asymmetry

While perfect symmetry can be beautiful and create a sense of stability, it is
usually not the best way to create a dynamic composition. Balanced asymmetry is
often more successful in creating movement, life, and interest through more
creative activation of space. It also requires more careful orchestration of
elements to achieve.
