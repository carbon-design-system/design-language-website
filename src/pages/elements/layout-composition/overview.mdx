> Quality deals with the judicious weighing of relationships, with balance, contrast, harmony, juxtaposition, between formal and functional elements—their transformation and enrichment. Further, it is concerned with ideas not techniques, with the enduring not the ephemeral, with precision not fussiness, with simplicity not vacuity, with subtlety not blatancy, with sensitivity not sentimentality.

## Point-of-view

When it comes to expressing our brand character, perhaps what's more important than our elements is how they all come together. Layout and composition is the way that each element is arranged in a given space, and careful consideration of it is essential to achieving the IBM look.

While the our look has evolved and will continue to evolve, what defines it is our approach to design—our philosophy, principles, and quality of craft. And it is the responsibility of every designer at IBM to uphold. 

When practicing layout and composition, certain criteria should be considered to express our distinct point-of-view. While the aggregate of IBM communications should employ the following design characteristics, individual designs need not feature all equally.
