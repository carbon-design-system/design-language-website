## Make and break patterns

In many ways, composition in design is very similar to musical composition. Melody, rhythm, harmony, timbre, and form—among others—are principles that can be translated across both design and music. Ultimately, both are driven by a careful balance of repetition and variation to create unity and interest.

Is it too repetitive and predictable? Is it too chaotic and lacking in structure? How do the elements relate to each other as well as the surrounding space?

Many relationships have already been made with our foundational elements: Our type scales and spacing scales are engineered for harmonious relationships between sizes. Our typeface shares common features with our iconography. The grid divides space evenly to create relationships between content and canvas. Logical, consistent use of these elements will establish repetition and draw relationships. Expressive use of them—where appropriate—can break expectations and create visual interest.

### Structural rhythm

Rhythm can be made from what is not on the canvas as much as what is. Consider a measure of music; repetition of notes without structure does not provide good rhythm. Once notes are placed regarding regular time intervals, however, rhythm emerges.

#### 2x Grid

[The 2x Grid](/elements/2x-grid) is the scaffolding on which IBM designers create structural rhythm. It provides structural, proportional, and spatial guidance for design within any media. Skillful use of it will yield harmonious spatial relationships between canvas and content while expressing our distinct point-of-view.

#### Sizing scale

In lieu of concrete vertical divisions, such as on a web page, the [sizing scale](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/layout#sizing-scale) is helpful in establishing vertical rhythm. Like a type scale, the sizing scale constrains the range of sizes to improve consistency and rhythm, while still allowing a wide range of sizes.

### Editorial rhythm

Editorial rhythm is driven by careful repetition and alternation of larger units of design. This is most often done in multi-page editorial design or scrolling web pages, where the viewer experiences one part of the whole at a time. 

The concept is well-established in music as form. Musical form describes the structure of a piece of music as a combination of units. Letters are given to the first occurrence of each unit, and the same letter is given to repeated units. In the AABA form for example, A units have similar melodic content as repeated A units, while the B unit offers an alternation to the A units to provide interest.

In design, larger visual units are driven by the content. Similar types of content can be given similar structure, such as the the same spatial dimensions, type sizes and hierarchy, and alignments. Consider how units can be repeated, and conversely, how structurally different units can break up the monotony of repeated ones. Repetition of units across multiple designs will drive continuity between them.

## Guide the eye

Design is successful when the viewer is guided through a composition via hierarchy. Proper hierarchy creates visual entry points to a design and guides the eye from one element to another in order of significance. Without it, one is forced to discern importance among equally-weighted elements, which leads to a flat design and poor experience. 

### Hierarchy of information

Typographic hierarchy is the navigational system that renders complex information accessible. Think of a book outline; the size, style, and position of type not only informs what order it should be read, but also describes the parent-child relationships of the content. Effective use of the [type scale](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/elements/type-specs-ui), along with an understanding of [Gestalt principles](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles), will ensure your design can be easily navigated and understood.

### Compositional flow

Aesthetically, facilitating eye movement through a composition creates a more interesting design. A focal point instantly attracts the eye to one area of the composition. Secondary and tertiary elements then draw the eye across the canvas, creating more engagement between the viewer and the design. It's important to plan this movement to guide the viewer emotionally and functionally forward to the intended outcome.

## Master asymmetry

While perfect symmetry can be beautiful and create a sense of stability, it is usually not the best way to create a dynamic composition. Balanced asymmetry is often more successful in creating movement, life, and interest through more creative activation of space. It also requires more careful orchestration of elements to achieve.

## Let it breathe

A classic offense that plagues many designers and non-designers alike is the overabundance of elements in a design. While utilizing all available space may reduce canvas size or scroll distance, it does more harm than good when it comes to a viewer's understanding of information. Overcrowding will render your design impenetrable. 

White space creates a visual pause between elements on the screen where the eye can rest. It sets things apart or brings them together to distinguish an element’s importance or priority. White space makes a layout feel clean and approachable while maintaining content-rich design.
