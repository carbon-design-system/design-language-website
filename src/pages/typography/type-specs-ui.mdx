<PageDescription>

Our bespoke corporate typeface, IBM Plex®, brings its own set of guidance and
best practices. Type specs help to set a starting point to apply typography—type
scales, styles and alignment on screens.

## Typeface

The IBM Plex® family comes in sans, serif, condensed and monospaced versions to
serve a variety of needs across all experiences. It has been specifically
designed to work well in digital environments and small or large scales. It
comes in extended Latin and non-Latin scripts. See the
[Typeface](/typography/typeface) page to learn more.

<div>

<Row>
<Column className="no-gap" colLg={8} noGutterSm>

<div class="typeface">

<span class="bx--type">IBM Plex Sans</span>
<span class="bx--type-serif">IBM Plex Serif</span>
<span class="bx--type-mono">IBM Plex Mono</span>
<span class="bx--type-condensed">IBM Plex Condensed</span>

</div>

</Column>
</Row>

```html
<span class="bx--type">IBM Plex Sans</span>
<span class="bx--type-serif">IBM Plex Serif</span>
<span class="bx--type-mono">IBM Plex Mono</span>
<span class="bx--type-condensed">IBM Plex Condensed</span>
```

</div>

## Scales

The IBM type scale is built on a single equation. The formula for our scale was
created to provide hierarchy for all types of experiences. The formula assumes
that y₀=12px.

<div>

<TypeScaleTable />

```
Xn = Xn-1 + {INT[(n-2)/4] + 1} * 2
Xn: step n type size Xn-1: step n-1 type size
```

</div>

## Style

Typography creates purposeful texture. It guides users to read and understand
the hierarchy of information. The right typographic treatment and the controlled
usage of type styles helps manage the display of content, keeping it useful,
simple and effective.

### Weights

We suggest use of IBM Plex Light, Regular, and Semibold for digital experiences.
The semibold weight is ideal for section headers, but should not be used for
long text.

<div>
  
<Row>
<Column className="no-gap" colLg={8} noGutterSm>

<div class="type-weight">

<span class="bx--type-semibold">Semibold</span>
<span class="bx--type-regular">Regular</span>
<span class="bx--type-light">Light</span>

</div>

</Column>
</Row>

```html
<span class="bx--type-semibold">Semibold</span>
<span class="bx--type-regular">Regular</span>
<span class="bx--type-light">Light</span>
```

</div>

### Italic

Each weight has an Italic style, which should only be used when you need to
emphasize certain words in a sentence (titles of works, technical terms, names
of devices, captions).

<div>

<Row>
<Column className="no-gap" colLg={8} noGutterSm>

<div class="type-weight">

<span class="bx--type-semibold bx--type-italic">Semibold</span>
<span class="bx--type-regular bx--type-italic">Regular</span>
<span class="bx--type-light bx--type-italic">Light</span>

</div>

</Column>
</Row>

```html
<span class="bx--type-semibold bx--type-italic">Semibold</span>
<span class="bx--type-regular bx--type-italic">Regular</span>
<span class="bx--type-light bx--type-italic">Light</span>
```

</div>

## Fluid type

To create a better experience along with our fluid grid, fluid type is an option
for large display type. We set up our fixed type scales for the breakpoints and
have them being fluid in between. This helps us to maintain the quality of
typography.

## Type set

Even though IBM Plex contains a wide range of scales, it’s important to use a
curated type set. For a clear and focused reading experience, consider content
needs and how type works across various screen sizes. The IBM type set includes
a Productive set designed primarily for product use and an Expressive set which
adds a series scales and fluid behavior.

#### Base type sizes

The productive type set uses a base type size of 14px, while the expressive type
set uses a base type size of 16px.

#### Style naming conventions

Within **Body styles** and **Supporting styles**, the same set of styles are
offered, and an easy way to spot which type set they belong to is to look at the
suffix. Productive styles are named with a suffix of `-01` and expressive style
names have a suffix of `-02`.

#### Two heading sets

There are two heading sets, one for productive and one for expressive. The major
difference between them is in how they are implemented in code because of the
nature of the pages.

- The productive type set uses _fixed_ headings. Product pages have a higher
  density of information housed inside containers for space efficiency, and in
  these situations fixed type styles are a must.

- The expressive type set has two fixed headings, for use where smaller headings
  are needed. The remaining headings are _fluid_. Web pages need to be able to
  flex and work at different breakpoints, and the fluid heading styles change
  size at different breakpoints, and can extrapolate/stretch in between sizes
  for smooth transitions.

### Utility styles

The utility styles are for use with productive and expressive moments and
include styles for code snippets, labels for captions and helper text, as well
as legal copy. Productive styles have a suffix of `-01` and expressive styles
have a suffix of `-02`.

<TypesetStyle typesets="smallStyle" />

### Body styles

There are two body styles for productive and expressive moments. Productive
styles have a suffix of `-01` and expressive styles have a suffix of `-02`.

<TypesetStyle typesets="body" />

### Fixed heading styles

The fixed heading styles are used for product pages where multiple containers
are used and space efficiency is key. Fixed means they are not responsive. The
type size remains constant regardless of break point.

Creators of web pages also use the fixed headings `-01` and `-02` where smaller
headings are needed.

<TypesetStyle typesets="fixedHeadings" />

### Fluid heading styles

The fluid heading styles are primarily used in web pages, and are therefore part
of the expressive set of type styles. These headings are responsive and the type
styles change size at different breakpoints.

Do not use these styles inside a container. They may be used in product pages
where text sits outside of a container, and a blend of expressive and productive
type styles is desired for hierarchy and distinction. For more information, see
[Type usage](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/styling-strategies).

<br />

<TypesetStyle typesets="fluidHeadings" breakpointControls={true} />

## Fluid display styles

The callout and display styles are part of the expressive set and being fluid,
they will adjust at different breakpoints. Do not use these styles inside a
container. For guidance about using display styles, see
[Type usage](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/styling-strategies#expressive-use-cases).

<TypesetStyle typesets="fluidCallouts,fluidDisplay" breakpointControls={true} />

## Type color

Careful consideration of color maintains quality and recognition for users.
Legibility and accessibility are two keys. Keep colored type neutral when in
paragraphs. Use primary blue for primary actions.
