Motion is a powerful tool in designing and building communication and user
experience. It can bring your work to life, guide users through complex
experiences, and help move forward—from here to there, now to next, start to
finish—and make progress.

## Paths

Elements of our interface dance on the 2x Grid. Motion paths trace lines along
the grid which never run diagonal.

<Caption>
  When expanding or moving elements across the screen, stagger the timing of
  horizontal and vertical animations to create a path with a rounded corner.

<Caption>
  Not staggering horizontal and vertical animations creates a straight diagonal
  path. It breaks the grid and is harsh to the eye.

    When removing an item from the grid, thumbnails on the edge existing and
    re-entering container create a smooth transition.

    Criss-cross sorting appears disorganized. Avoid this motion path.

## Composition

When multiple animated elements coexist or interact with each other within the
same view, it is vital to make the many moving elements work together and form
coherent experience, to better provide way-finding and focus to guide the user
experience.

### Consistency

When elements convey the same meaning, or perform the same functions, use the
same motion for them. Similarly, actions with dramatically different meaning and
intent should carry different motions. This helps to reinforce the meaning
behind a motion, and improves user’s proficiency with the interface.

In the example shown here, both expanding a row of a data table and opening a
dropdown uses a chevron and share similar intent—to reveal content hidden in a
seam. Therefore, they should have the same motion style (Productive) and easing
(entrance, standard), albeit different durations due to their difference in
size.

Pay attention to the spatial relationships between elements and screens, and
information hierarchy. Visually similar elements may need the different motions
to respect their relative spatial locations.

<Caption>
  When the new content panel is on a higher layer, motion is “sliding”, moving
  content within with the panel. Also always dim the content below when a new
  layer is introduced above.

/>
<Caption>
  When the new content panel is on the same layer, motion is “pushing”,
  revealing content within with a mask.
</Caption>

Effective use of inconsistency in motion highlights a difference in meaning or
intent behind actions with similar visual appearance.

  <Caption>
    Use motion to reinforce meaning. Affirmative action here triggers a different exit motion for the modal than negation.

</Column>
</Row>

### Continuity

Motion can help by establishing a sense of continuity between screens and
experiences. Pay attention to shared elements across screens, such as the title
panels, or buttons, to create a graceful transition.

<Caption>
  Shared elements can effectively guide users through a multi-layered
  information architecture.

      poster="/videos/motion/motion-continuity-dont.jpg"
    />
    <Caption>
      Continuous elements are for guidance and should not distract. Always
      finish a sequence with the important content on page.
    </Caption>
  </Column>
</Row>

## Sequence & stagger

When multiple elements need to animate, distribute their entrances over time
instead of introducing everything at the user at once. This will help user to
understand the content and orient themselves.

For example, staggering the entrance of table content by 20ms significantly
reduces the cognitive load. Depending on the number of staggered elements, the
delay should be adjusted to ensure total time is still within 500 ms.

Sequence the loading of page content when possible. Start with the most
orienting content, such as the static content and header, and end with the most
important information, such as the call-to-action button or a calculation
result, to focus user’s attention to them.

<Video

<Caption>
  Sequencing of this interface prioritizes the primary button, and reserves data
  visualization for later when users begin to scroll, indicating intention to
  dive deeper.
</Caption>

Follow this recommended sequence of different types of content when
choreographing content entrance. Not all categories might be present in every
experience.
