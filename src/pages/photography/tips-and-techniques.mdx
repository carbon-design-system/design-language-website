When choosing or creating an IBM image, certain criteria should be considered.
The following guidance will help achieve the effect and impression we’re
looking for.

## Perspective

As IBMers, we are objective observers of the working world. This translates into the perspectives we commonly use in photography. There are two primary viewpoints, each deliberately designed to present the world “as-is” and at its beautiful best.

### Eye level

We are a forward-facing organization. We treat our clients and ourselves as equals. Imagine IBM or an IBMer is the camera, this is how we view the world around us; authentically, eye-to-eye, fairly, naturally, truthfully. We take a step back, capture context, observe the environment, and present a bigger picture.

<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>

</Column>

</Row>

## Aerial

Used less often, another angle we take is to offer things from a different perspective. Equally as objective, an aerial view allows us to “elevate” our observations. This communicates a certain “eye” on consequences and impact at scale.

</Row>

## Composition

Image composition is the intentional arrangement of individual subjects within a scene to form the final image. There are two key aspects to composition that you should consider for every image.

### Framing

The 2x Grid can be a useful guide when thinking about composing imagery and positioning subjects. Images should leverage divisions of two. Either horizontal or vertical, these divisions create zones for subjects, allowing for carefully considered compositions that feel kinetic, like moments in time.

### Focal points

Use the 2x Grid to establish clear focal points. It may seem prescriptive, but when seen together this approach acts as connective tissue between IBM images. The same approach is used to create delightful film experiences.

</Column>
</Row>

## Lighting

Whenever possible, use natural light or techniques that simulate natural light. IBM imagery is allergic to artificiality. The sincere portrayal of subject is paramount. We cannot manufacture a better reality than reality itself.

  type="dont"
  caption="Avoid color washes and grading">

</DoDontExample>

</Column>
</Row>

## Depth-of-field

Everything should be in sharp focus. This crisp approach reinforces a deep interest in everything, and an emphasis on context and detail. Everything is presented evenly.

<Row>
<Column colMd={3} colLg={4}>

  type="dont"
  caption="Avoid images that fall off focus too quickly">

![depth dont example](./images/tips-and-techniques/depth-dont-2.jpg)

</DoDontExample>

</Column>
</Row>

## Effects and filters

Avoid anything artificial. We’re a fact-based company. We communicate with clarity, and our photography should communicate this too. We avoid hyperbole and jargon. Our imagery should avoid spin and overstyling as well.

<Row>
<Column colMd={3} colLg={4}>

<DoDontExample
  type="dont"
  caption="Avoid images with added glare or elements that have been clearly added via photoshop">

</DoDontExample>

</Column>

<Column colMd={3} colLg={4}>

<DoDontExample
  type="dont"
  caption="Avoid images that have color or image overlays">

![effects dont example](./images/tips-and-techniques/effects-dont-2.jpg)

</DoDontExample>

</Column>
</Row>

## Clichés, metaphors & see-say

When it comes to photography, people respond to what they don’t see as much as what they do see. Too often, imagery is used to double-down on what is already understood versus adding depth and dimension. We should use imagery purposefully, to expand ideas and elicit emotion.

We are a fact-based, insightful, opinionated organization. Therefore, we try to avoid abstraction in favor of palatability and tangibility. If an image looks like it could have been created by any other organization, it’s probably lacking a distinct point-of-view (style or subject) or purposeful use that is uniquely IBM.
