#### Title, labels and legend

<Row>
<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>


The title should reflect the main insight the data reveals. The legend should
explain the chart’s meaning by defining the association of each visual property,
such as color, shape and size, to the corresponding data. When possible, use
labels directly on the chart to avoid long legends. All the text should be
concise and easy to understand.

#### Axes, ticks and grid

<Row>
<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>


Axes, ticks and the grid should help the reader understand the proportions and
scale of the data, the indicators involved and their unit of measure. Avoid
filling the chart frame with too many elements, as it impacts the user’s ability
to interpret the data.

## Color

The application of the IBM color palette brings a unified and recognizable
consistency to the array of digital products and interfaces. This color pallette
applies to data visualization, as well, but isn’t restricted to appearance only;
it decreases recognition times, conveys meaning and helps users make faster,
more informed decisions. When designing IBM’s data visualization, be sure to
maximize accessibility and harmony, but also keep an eye on cultural and
psychological contexts.

#### Emphasize the story you want to tell

Color is one of the most powerful sensory cues and a highly influential visual
property. Create a sharp contrast between elements to focus the user's attention
on the meaning of the chart, but be essential—every color should have a reason
for being there. Conversely, even the absence of color delivers information.

Shades of grey ensure data points are visible while not distracting from the key
insights. On the other hand, connecting specific colors to certain key metrics
helps your audience easily recognize frequent indicators.

#### Improve readability and hierarchy of elements

Caring about contrast means caring if users will be able to read your chart on
their screens, even in low light and if you use shades of colors like light
grey. Well-chosen colors reduce the time for viewers to gain insights and help
them understand the message sooner. Rely on categorical palettes if you want to
maximize contrast between data that doesn’t have an inherent relationship, while
sequential palettes are good to show relationships or hierarchies between data.
Reinforce color meaning with other strong visual features, like shape, line or
pattern, to make the focal point immediately recognizable.

#### Represent quantity

Color can convey meaning. By illuminating a chart through sequential or
diverging palettes, you add depth and dimension to specific data, drawing
attention to the quantitative aspect of the story.

#### Texture and markers

<Row>
<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>


Visualizations can be rich and “colorful,” even in situations when color can’t
be used. IBM employs different shades of black, together with patterns and
markers, as a valid substitute for color. Patterns aren’t just a decoration, but
become a way to convey information. Use lines with different weights and play
with the density of elements.

## Interaction

<Row>
<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>


At IBM, we’re curious. When we think something should be explored, we follow
that impulse and see where it leads. Thus, we want our data visualization
audience to explore problems from multiple perspectives with interaction
patterns like searching, filtering or highlighting.

</Column>
</Row>


Interactivity is an essential feature that turns your visualization into a tool
to foster data exploration and improve user understanding by creating
recognition, shortening the learning curve. A visualization reaches its maximum
value when it allows users to find their own exploration path.

#### Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand

We want data visualization to present crucial points clearly and prominently for
quick and easy reading, providing clear insights while still giving the user the
option to get more information on demand at any time. Don’t hide important
information behind an interactive behavior. Interaction should support
analytical reasoning and user comprehension by revealing context, insights,
associations and causality.

## Motion

<Row>
<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>


Motion is a powerful tool in designing and building communication and user
experience. We use data visualization to communicate relationships between
elements and make changes in the data set or on the environment explicit, clear
and unambiguous. Consider the entrance and exit motions to enhance the visual
hierarchy of elements, orientation of axes and the data displayed. Be careful
not to communicate contradicting information with different transitions.
