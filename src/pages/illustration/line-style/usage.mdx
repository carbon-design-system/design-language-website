<PageDescription>

IBM Line style has many environments it can be used in as well as particular animation techniques designed to best express the inherent nature of the line work. Line style is best used for light and airy expressions that compliment the content.

## Animation

The forthright construction and reduced aesthetic of line style animations lend themselves particularly well to deftly applied stroke effects and geometrically driven animation.

#### Tips
- Shapes should stay true to the original design. Be careful of custom path animation and rely on `position`, `rotation` and `scale`.
- Ensure gradients track with strokes as they move through the frame.
- Simple camera moves can be applied on rare occasions, but only if they further the message.
- Utilize shape layers in Adobe After Effects to create rectangles and circles to maintain flexibility, while ensuring precision.

### Gradients

Gradients can add interest to uncomplicated animations but can be technically challenging to execute well. When illustrating for motion, avoid creating or animating complex gradients unless they’re necessary to convey the message.

### Offset and overlap

When offsetting the movement of objects, it’s crucial that we prevent overlapping linework. Closely offset elements feel guided and finely choreographed. In the reverse, overlapping strokes create an impression of busyness and disorder.

### Design-first performance

In general, line illustrations that depict faces, hands or anatomy can feel alien and rigid when animated with realistic movements. Instead, lean into the graphic nature of each composition, animating the underlying graphic shapes to gesture at realism, without closely imitating it.
