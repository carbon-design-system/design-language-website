title: Line style
description:
  Line style illustrations use limited line weights and a small grid to convey
  concepts with precision and yet a wide latitude for expression.

<PageDescription>

We apply line style effectively across many formats—from technical drawings to
spot illustrations to extended multimedia campaigns that support complex
narratives. Its light and airy quality suits more subtle visual expressions,
while its precise and engineered nature ideally expresses diagrams and more
detailed scenarios.

## Animation

The forthright construction and reduced aesthetic of line-style animations lend
themselves particularly well to deftly applied stroke effects and geometrically
driven animation.

#### Tips

- Keep shapes true to the original design. Be careful of custom path animation
  and rely on `position`, `rotation` and `scale`.
- Ensure gradients track with strokes as they move through the frame.
- Apply simple camera moves on rare occasions, but only if they further the
  message.
- Utilize shape layers in Adobe After Effects to create rectangles and circles
  to maintain flexibility, while ensuring precision.

### Gradients

Gradients can add interest to uncomplicated animations but can be technically
challenging to execute well. When illustrating for motion, avoid creating or
animating complex gradients unless they’re necessary to convey the message.

### Offset and overlap

When offsetting the movement of objects, it’s crucial that we prevent
overlapping linework. Closely offset elements feel guided and finely
choreographed. Conversely, overlapping strokes create an impression of busyness
and disorder.

### Design-first performance

In general, line illustrations that depict faces, hands or the anatomy can feel
alien and rigid when animated with realistic movements. Instead, lean into the
graphic nature of each composition, animating the underlying graphic shapes to
gesture at realism, without closely imitating it.
