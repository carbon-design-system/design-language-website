## Collaboration and approvals

We’re counting on your creativity to help bring the IBM Design Language to life
in everything designed for IBM. Please loop in a member of the IBM Brand
Experience Design team early in the creative process for all significant new
projects, so that we can help you learn to correctly and creatively express the
IBM Design Language.

To advise the team on new projects and coordinate their participation, please
send a message to our Slack channel
[#ibm-design-language](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/messages/C0U35LB2B), with a
brief description of the project, the timeline and the names of the main IBM and
agency contacts. If you're an outside vendor or agency, or don’t have access to
IBM’s Slack channels, please email these details to
[designlanguage@us.ibm.com](mailto:designlanguage@us.ibm.com) with the subject:
IDL Sponsor User Group request.
