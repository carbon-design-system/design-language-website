## Collaboration and approvals

We are counting on your creativity to help bring the IBM Design Language to life in everything designed for IBM. Please loop in a member of the Brand Experience Design team early in the creative process for all significant new projects, so that we can help you learn to correctly and creatively express the IBM Design Language.

To advise the team on new projects and coordinate their participation, please send a message to our Slack channel [#ibm-design-language](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/messages/C0U35LB2B), with a brief description of the project, the timeline and the names of the main IBM and agency contacts. If you are an agency partner, or do not have access to IBM’s Slack channels, please email these details to: [designlanguage@us.ibm.com]() with the subject: IDL Sponsor User Group request.

## Questions?

Please take some time to explore the content on this website before reaching out to the IBM Design team. The site is very comprehensive and most of the guidelines and components are well documented. However, if you still have a specific question:

1. Please check whether there is an existing answer on our [FAQ page]().
2. If your question relates to a discipline area, please go to the FAQ section within that site:
    1. [Product Design (Carbon) FAQ](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/help/faq)
    1. [Digital Design FAQ](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/faq.html)
    1. [Brand Center FAQ](https://www.ibm.com/brand/help/faq)
3. Please search the [#IBM-design-language](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/messages/C0U35LB2B) Slack channel to see if an answer to your question has already been provided there. Slack’s filtering feature will return targeted and relevant results. For instance, if you have a question about the color palette, you could search “palette” in Slack and filter your search results by channel selecting #IBM-design-language. Alternatively, you could paste “yoursearchterm in:[#IBM-design-language](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/messages/C0U35LB2B)” into the Slack search box. Tip: You can start a new search directly from the message box using the /s slash command.
4. If you can’t find an existing answer to your question, please ask the team directly:
    1. For general questions, please use [#IBM-design-language](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/messages/C0U35LB2B)
