<AccordionItem title="What’s the business driver behind the creation of IBM Design Language?">
  IBM Design Language was created as a result of the design teams across IBM
  coming together as one to create a single, common, unifying system. It
  expresses the IBM brand in a digital system, visual and verbal assets, and
  actionable guidance. Implementing it creates a stronger, more unified brand
  presence across the business with greater efficiencies, point of view (POV),
  curation and instant recognition. The design philosophy informs the IBM Design
  Language and expresses the POV on design for IBM.
