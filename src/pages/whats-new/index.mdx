We are continuously working to extend the IBM Plex® typeface family internationally. After over a year of development effort, we’re proud to release IBM Plex Sans KR. This Korean language typeface is the first of our rigorous and on-going Plex CJK project, which will include Chinese and Japanese, as well. IBM Plex Sans KR is available in all eight weights and includes hinting for optimized performance in digital environments. IBM Plex Sans KR is open source and now available to [download](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases/latest) on GitHub. To see how the typeface looks, play with it or any of the Plex scripts using our Typetester tool on the [Typeface](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/typography/typeface#type-tester) page.<br/>— <br/>10 June, 2020

IBM builds systems and services to help our clients reduce and solve problems every day. Our illustrations have a distinct purpose as well—to communicate difficult concepts at a glance, in diverse and delightful ways. Nimble illustrations help users understand complex ideas. They uphold the engineered nature of the IBM brand through precise adherence to the grid, along with consistent use of a system of angles, shapes and radii. Learn more about how we use line, flat and isometric style to craft visual elements that extend our rich visual history in [Illustration](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/illustration/overview).<br/>— <br/>23 March, 2020

Usable data is a central value IBM provides to our customers. Accurate, understandable data visualization relies on clarity delivered through typography using visual models that employ structure, contrast and rhythm. Consistency in style and scale provides user confidence in the integrity of data. Context maximizes the environmental constraints to enhance audience comprehension of the data. Now the IBM Design Language provides a distinctive rationale for visual representation of the IBM brand. Use this new guidance to create on-brand [data visualization](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/data-visualization/overview) with impact.<br/>— <br/>23 March, 2020
