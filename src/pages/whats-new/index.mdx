Humanity is integral to our work. It fosters insights we use to bring people and technologies together that create outcomes larger than we could ever accomplish alone. We celebrate humanity's vast diversity—of personalities, cultures and abilities—through inclusive illustration guidance that features an established aesthetic that’s identifiably IBM. Check out our [People](/illustration/people) page, where you'll find a distinct color palette for representing skin tones, precise geometry for realistic proportions, useful tips for creating portraits and more.<br/>— <br/>20 May, 2022
