## Expressive pictograms

<Row className={gridImages}>

</Column>
</Row>


IBM Design Language is a dynamic system that continually builds on the existing elements. Expressive pictograms are a natural evolution in our iconography portfolio. If you are looking for a different way to add bold graphic interest to your work, consider expressive pictograms. Based on our popular pictograms, these graphic elements pop with the considered application of color. Gradients are particularly striking on expressive pictograms as you convey brand-specific color palettes in your work. Learn about the differences between [pictogram types](/iconography/pictograms/design/#pictogram-types), how [pictogram strokes](/iconography/pictograms/design/#expressive-pictogram-strokes) differ, and how to [apply color to expressive pictograms](/iconography/pictograms/design/#expressive-pictogram-color) on the IBM Design Language [Pictograms Design](/iconography/pictograms/design/) page.<br/>— <br/>12 May, 2021

</Column>

Because imagery sets the overall impression of a brand, its impact can’t be underestimated. In a digital world, the window for capturing a user’s interest is very small. What they see and don’t see all have the power to elevate or diminish our brand. Learn about the IBM POV, including guidance on how to secure the photography, illustration or renderings you want for your next project, on the new IBM Brand Center [Imagery](https://www.ibm.com/brand/imagery/) page. Plan now to invest in our imagery because there’s nothing “stock” about IBM.<br/>— <br/>13 April, 2021

Do you need to create illustrations? We’ve built Adobe Illustrator starter kits to help you accelerate your proficiency in building compelling, on-brand illustrations. In them you’ll find basics like grids, a primer on the underlying anatomy of each style and a foundational set of simple elements you can use alone or recombine to form your own new illustration narratives. Each kit includes an inspiration gallery of examples showing techniques. These examples aren’t a library of ready-made art; they’re solely provided to help inform your explorations. Use them to study and deconstruct the technical aspects of these versatile styles. Find the kits for [line](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/illustration/line-style/design#resources), [flat](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/illustration/flat-style/design#resources) or [isometric](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/illustration/isometric-style/design#resources) style art here, and learn more about [illustration](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/illustration/overview/) at IBM.<br/>— <br/>09 February, 2021

## Iconography contributions

The IBM Design Language now has over 500 [pictograms](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/pictograms/library) and 1,000 [UI icons](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/ui-icons/library) available for download. Pictograms are used across IBM, from websites and events to merchandise and brochures. Our UI icons are specially sized for user interface applications, purposefully built into IBM products and web pages. Though pictograms and UI icons are small, they play a mighty role in embedding the IBM Design Language deep in our brand. We welcome designers who want to contribute to our libraries. Whether you have just one concept or a whole batch of new ideas, discover how to submit your artwork to our [UI icons](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/ui-icons/contribute) and [Pictograms](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/pictograms/contribute) libraries.<br/>— <br/>22 October, 2020

Our corporate identity is the IBM name and the IBM 8-bar logo. The way in which we apply both is a reflection of the IBM business strategy—to be a single, globally integrated enterprise. Wherever it appears, the IBM name and logo should always maintain and build the strength of the IBM brand. The [logo request](http://www.ibm.com/brand/ibm-logos/logo-requests/) page can help you secure the proper approvals and images to protect our valuable logo asset. On it, logo downloads are available for IBMers and approved IBM suppliers who are required to adhere to certain terms and conditions to protect against misuse. An IBMid is required for downloads.<br/>— <br/>25 September, 2020

</Column>

At IBM, our forward progress is constant, and every move reflects the need to be
essential. When using animation, every element we set in motion is an extension
of our voice—it must serve a purpose, embody precision and communicate clearly.
We use several animation styles to serve a wide range of needs. Whether using
line, flat or isometric style, effective animation is simple yet concise and
engineered. See examples and guidance on the IBM Design Language

We are continuously working to extend the IBM Plex® typeface family
internationally. After over a year of development effort, we’re proud to release
IBM Plex Sans KR. This Korean language typeface is the first of our rigorous and
on-going Plex CJK project, which will include Chinese and Japanese, as well. IBM
Plex Sans KR is available in all eight weights and includes hinting for
optimized performance in digital environments. IBM Plex Sans KR is open source
and now available to [download](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases/latest) on
GitHub. To see how the typeface looks, play with it or any of the Plex scripts

IBM builds systems and services to help our clients reduce and solve problems
every day. Our illustrations have a distinct purpose as well—to communicate
difficult concepts at a glance, in diverse and delightful ways. Nimble
illustrations help users understand complex ideas. They uphold the engineered
nature of the IBM brand through precise adherence to the grid, along with
consistent use of a system of angles, shapes and radii. Learn more about how we
use line, flat and isometric style to craft visual elements that extend our rich

<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>


[![link to data visualization overview](./images/IBM_data_vis.png)](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/data-visualization/overview)

</Column>
</Row>


Usable data is a central value IBM provides to our customers. Accurate,
understandable data visualization relies on clarity delivered through typography
using visual models that employ structure, contrast and rhythm. Consistency in
style and scale provides user confidence in the integrity of data. Context
maximizes the environmental constraints to enhance audience comprehension of the
data. Now the IBM Design Language provides a distinctive rationale for visual
representation of the IBM brand. Use this new guidance to create on-brand
[data visualization](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/data-visualization/overview)
