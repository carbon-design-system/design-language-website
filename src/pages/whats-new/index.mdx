## Iconography contributions

<Row>
<Column colLg={8} colMd={6}>


![Iconography](./images/icons-pictograms.png)

</Column>
</Row>


The IBM Design Language now has over 500 [pictograms](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/pictograms/library) and 1,000 [UI icons](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/ui-icons/library) available for download. Pictograms are used across IBM, from websites and events to merchandise and brochures. Our UI icons are specially sized for user interface applications, purposefully built into IBM products and web pages. Though pictograms and UI icons are small, they play a mighty role in embedding the IBM Design Language deep in our brand. We welcome designers who want to contribute to our libraries. Whether you have just one concept or a whole batch of new ideas, discover how to submit your artwork to our [UI icons](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/ui-icons/contribute) and [Pictograms](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/pictograms/contribute) libraries.<br/>— <br/>22 October, 2020

IBM app icons are expressive and distinct, visually communicating the core idea of a product or service in objective or abstract form. Across web platforms, product marketplaces and in native applications, these icons help users identify apps at a glance. To find out more about these important brand elements, visit our [app icon library](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/app-icons/library) in the Iconography section of IBM Design Language. From there, you can find an overview of how to [design app icons](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/app-icons/design), plus guidance for [app icon usage](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/app-icons/usage) and [production](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/app-icons/production).<br/>— <br/>06 October, 2020

[![link to Logo requests](./images/logo-request.png)](http://www.ibm.com/brand/ibm-logos/logo-requests/)

</Column>
</Row>


Our corporate identity is the IBM name and the IBM 8-bar logo. The way in which we apply both is a reflection of the IBM business strategy—to be a single, globally integrated enterprise. Wherever it appears, the IBM name and logo should always maintain and build the strength of the IBM brand. The [logo request](http://www.ibm.com/brand/ibm-logos/logo-requests/) page can help you secure the proper approvals and images to protect our valuable logo asset. On it, logo downloads are available for IBMers and approved IBM suppliers who are required to adhere to certain terms and conditions to protect against misuse. An IBMid is required for downloads.<br/>— <br/>25 September, 2020

</Column>
</Row>


At IBM, our forward progress is constant, and every move reflects the need to be
essential. When using animation, every element we set in motion is an extension
of our voice—it must serve a purpose, embody precision and communicate clearly.
We use several animation styles to serve a wide range of needs. Whether using
line, flat or isometric style, effective animation is simple yet concise and
engineered. See examples and guidance on the IBM Design Language

We are continuously working to extend the IBM Plex® typeface family

IBM Plex Sans KR. This Korean language typeface is the first of our rigorous and
on-going Plex CJK project, which will include Chinese and Japanese, as well. IBM

</Column>

IBM builds systems and services to help our clients reduce and solve problems
every day. Our illustrations have a distinct purpose as well—to communicate
difficult concepts at a glance, in diverse and delightful ways. Nimble
illustrations help users understand complex ideas. They uphold the engineered
nature of the IBM brand through precise adherence to the grid, along with
consistent use of a system of angles, shapes and radii. Learn more about how we
use line, flat and isometric style to craft visual elements that extend our rich

## Data visualization guidance

<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>


[![link to data visualization overview](./images/IBM_data_vis.png)](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/data-visualization/overview)

</Column>
</Row>


Usable data is a central value IBM provides to our customers. Accurate,
understandable data visualization relies on clarity delivered through typography
using visual models that employ structure, contrast and rhythm. Consistency in
style and scale provides user confidence in the integrity of data. Context
maximizes the environmental constraints to enhance audience comprehension of the
data. Now the IBM Design Language provides a distinctive rationale for visual
representation of the IBM brand. Use this new guidance to create on-brand
[data visualization](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/data-visualization/overview)
